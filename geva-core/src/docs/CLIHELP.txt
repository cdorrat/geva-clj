Usage:
---- print operation ----
- print                        --> prints the entire population
- print x                      --> prints the individual at index 
                                   x in the population
- print x:y                    --> print all individuals in the 
                                   range [x,y]

---- iterate operation ----
iterate                        --> iterate one generation

---- getMaxGens operation ----
getMaxGens                     --> get total number of generations
---- setFitness operation ----
- setFitness x n               --> sets the fitness of the individual 
                                   at index x to n
- setFitness x:y n             --> sets the fitness of all individuals 
                                   in the range [x,y] to n

---- interpolate operation ----
- interpolate x0 w0 x1 w1 ...  --> prints an individual derived
                                   by interpolating individuals xi
				   with weights wi
- interpolate x w y            --> special case: prints an individual 
                                   derived by interpolating x and y
				   with weights w and (1 - w)

---- crossover operation ----
- crossover x y                --> prints an individual derived by 
                                   crossing-over individuals x and y
  	      	   
---- Misc operations ----
- help                         --> prints the help screen
- exit                         --> kills the current GEVA run 
- quit                         --> kills the current GEVA run
