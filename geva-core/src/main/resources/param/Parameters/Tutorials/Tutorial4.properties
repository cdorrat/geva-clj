#GENERAL
# Population size tells the initialiser module how many individuals to create in the population.
population_size = 100
# How many times the genotype is allowed to wrap
max_wraps = 1

#INITIALISATION - Specifies which module to use as an initialiser. In this case Operator.Initialiser is used, it's the basic model which initialises with completely random integer strings. See the API for details of other initialisation options.
initialiser = geva.Operator.Initialiser
# The chromosomes are variable length structures and can grow and shrink as due to mutation and crossover. For completly random initialisation an initial chromosome length needs to be specified. The initialiser will random create integer strings in this case of length 200
initial_chromosome_size = 200

#GRAMMAR - Grammatical evolution uses a context free grammar to map from a string of integers to a program or other structure. GEVA uses files with the extension .bnf for grammars, and they shold be located in param/Grammar/ directory.
